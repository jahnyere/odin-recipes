    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.
        <li>Cut 600g of sweet potatoes into rough 3cm chunks, then toss in a roasting tin with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. <li>Roast for 40 minutes, or until soft, golden and gnarly.</li>
        <li> Place a small pan on a medium heat with 1 teaspoon of olive oil.
        <li>Peel and finely slice 2 cloves of garlic, then add to the pan along with ½ a teaspoon each of sweet smoked paprika and ground cumin. <li>Fry for 1 to 2 minutes, then tip in 1 x 400g tin of black beans (juice and all), plus 1 tin’s worth of water and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste, then remove from the heat and blitz with a hand blender until smooth. Return to a low heat and leave to tick away.
        <li>Meanwhile, cook 150g of long grain rice in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain.
        <li>Place 200g of spinach in a colander above the rice and leave to wilt for a few minutes, then squeeze out any excess water.
        <li>For the salsa, trim and finely slice 6 spring onions, then place in a bowl with the 100g of sliced pickled jalapeños and a splash of pickling juice. Pick in the leaves from ½ a bunch of fresh coriander (15g) and give everything a good mix.
        <li>To assemble the burritos, load up the tortillas with the sweet potatoes, rice and spinach, wrap up, then slice in half. <li>Pour the black bean sauce between 4 plates, and arrange the burritos on top. Serve each topped with some jalapeño salsa and 1 tablespoon of dairy-free yoghurt. Cut 1 to 2 limes into wedges for squeezing over.</li>
